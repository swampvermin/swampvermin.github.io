            I was initially drawn to this specific work because I have enjoyed looking through archival projects in the past, and I thought the site's features looked really cool. I also enjoyed the use of ascii art throughout the page, which induced nostalgia for the early 2000s. The use of keyboard symbols to create a style for this site resonated with me; it adds a bit of quirkiness to the site. While clicking on links, I immediately noticed that many of them were dead, as in no longer working. This, however, reminded me that the web medium is finite, it's the nature of the beast. Even though many sites are no longer existing, this website is a way to cement that they indeed existed, even if it can no longer be experienced.

            When looking through all the net art projects on the anthology website, I started creating an extensive list of each project I was interested in. While I enjoyed most of the general concepts of these sites, I find netart in general to be very confusing and convoluted. Most of the sites lead you down rabbit holes with no way to return to the original page unless you pressed the back button too many times to count. There seemed to be a common theme of making their websites as mentally tiring as possible. Then, I came across the NetArt Latino Database. I was immediately interested in the ascii art and the simplicity of the siteâ€™s presentation. Easy to read, easy to navigate, and interesting to look at. It hit all the key points of visual aesthetics for me, regardless of content. I was also very interested in learning more about this latino subculture of netart and how that may differ from the white, North American netart that was in the rest of the NetArt Anthology website. As someone who has an elementary level understanding of Spanish, I was also really interested in how the visual language of the internet would convey the messages of the artists since the text was entirely in Spanish.
