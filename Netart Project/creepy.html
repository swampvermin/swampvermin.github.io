      <h4>&#8258;  Biography  &#8258;</h4>
    <p>Alcides Martínez Portillo was a major artist, a pioneer of new media in the Río de la Plata, he crossed conceptualist poetics, he was a precursor of electronic music and the post-dictatorship underground movement. His exile and his sudden death disintegrated his work, which today can only be accessed through a search of the affective network. We consider that this project is an essential work to support the history of recent art, creating a source of consultation that did not exist until now. - <a href="https://www.amp.uy">amp map</a></p>

          This is a dark and stange site created by Portillo. As I click on different images and text on the page, I'm taken through a seemingly endless assortment of pages, each with eerie gifts, images, or creptic text. Sometimes I end up getting caught in a loop and links I click take me back to where I started, other times I manage to be taken to a new page, an even further advancement through this maze. It becomes a game. How far can I get? Where does it end? <strong> Does it end?</strong>
